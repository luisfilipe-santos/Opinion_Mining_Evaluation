They're out there .	4

So which way you taking ?	2

It's the first time he's told me the truth !	1

I'm wondering too because this really wasn't part of the plan .	4

I love him .	5

There's no hard feelings between us .	6

I am content .	8

Hold it !	1

I saw it coming , but what could I do ?	2

How stupid of me !	1

And they told me that you weren't that smart .	1

I don't want him hollering out any windows either .	1

Well , I'd like to help you out , mister . There's nothing I can do .	8

There's no cause for temper , child .	1

Hi , honey .	5

A little wine with music .	5

So welcome to Elysian Fields .	5

You don't know from one day to the next ... whether you're going to be killed , go home , or get busted .	4

Oh , that's funny .	5

You're crazier than a mule - humping goat .	7

The horse ? - The horse .	7

All I can charge him with is riding on a train . They're gonna walk .	2

I think [PERSON] will win .	2

â™ª Slimy , cold seaweed dishes when they ate it â™ª	3

You're imagining things .	8

Carefully !	4

I'm a three - time loser , [PERSON] .	1

Well , how do you think that I make ends meet with your father Gallivanting off to [LOCATION] ?	2

Go back to the perimeter , you pinhead .	1

Think much , pea brain ?	4

Only two months ' treatment , and I'm a well man .	8

In my dreams I saw a light over [LOCATION] and I knew there was hope .	2

Hmm . - ( imitates monkey gibbering )	3

The party's over here . Please . No ?	2

We'll take care of him , sir .	8

â™ª ' Bout the flapping ' fish and the girls I've loved â™ª	5

I'm sure it will turn up somewhere .	2

Badly I want you .	1

Forgive me .	6

Now get . It's all right , [PERSON] .	8

Could you do it for me today , please ?	8

All those guns and violence ...	4

A lot of the gauges over the engineer's ... panel are broken .	6

And it's good to see you again .	5

I think I'm going to make tomorrow their last day on this planet .	2

I'm busy as the devil !	1

Something about your mother .	4

It has happened to me without my wanting , almost without my knowing .	6

We'd be pleased if you would .	5

Could we just go over one or two more ...	2

So what else is new ?	2

When Mr [PERSON]'s feet hurt , he drives the whole house crazy .	1

I demand that you free the Childlike Empress !	3

That must have been very nice .	5

If we lose , get out of town quick .	4

And Miss [PERSON]'s waiting .	2

Come on , what are you fellows gaping at ?	3

Your mama was fine .	5

Maybe I wanted to see your face naked , no guard up , how you really felt hoping I would be wrong about something that I knew my entire life .	1

Open your eyes !	1

Self - experimentation is against the rules of good research .	8

I want to talk to you guys for a second .	2

I hate you !	1

Mean gene : He's coming back , Ladies and gentlemen .	2

This time , in sight of my goal , it seemed as if I must meet defeat .	6

She'll lend you an air of respectability if that's possible .	8

I'm not asking you , I'm telling you . You're in danger .	4

[PERSON] . Thank you .	8

He's all tired out , though , the poor little guy .	6

Can I have a Scotch and soda ?	2

I got ta stay with her .	8

Also , I'm in love . I. . . I'd like to get married .	5

I got shoes . Wan na see ?	6

I'll disinherit him .	2

You are far prettier than I ever imagined .	5

We got 'em !	2

Can't I do what I think is right ?	4

I wanted to blame myself even for the man who had taken me .	6

You've no right to think what you do about me .	1

It is not usually he writes to me .	6

Now , listen , stow the chatter , mate , and get on that banjo .	2

Amine , can you hear me ?	2

[PERSON] , we've got a serious problem .	4

But I can order with the best of 'em .	8

What he did was , he just took my money .	7

I'm an old man who will live until I die .	6

Any guy who says he can fence $ 50,000 , is crazy .	1

All I'm saying is maybe all the child needs is to be loved .	6

That Miss [PERSON] is about the prettiest girl I ever did see .	5

How do I know you'll jump ?	2

And that's why I don't wan na talk about it if I don't have to .	1

That old man is a sick character .	3

Admiral know what that is ?	2

You see how much we accomplish when you appear ?	2

The Cold War is over , Mrs. Acting President .	6

That should give you the real overview of where we're headed .	2

I hope you have a nice stay in [LOCATION] .	5

Anyway , the president of this teamster local back east set up a phony welfare fund , right ?	1

She ain't gonna talk , man .	1

Now , your gallant Maj. [PERSON] is selling me a phony . So he deserves whatever he gets .	3

Come on , [PERSON] . We got ta move !	2

Probably not .	1

Maryk showed me a log he had written on [PERSON]'s behaviour .	3

Rock , go !	2

Ted , thanks .	8

Carry on , men .	8

You've always had to work ?	7

Yeah . Just call me . - When ?	1

Good luck , Mom .	8

She's a wonderful wife to me , too .	5

Tri Face !	4

I - I took some sleeping pills .	4

It hurts , hurts , hurts .	6

You're the experts .	7

You will be cooperative ?	2

I feel I should be doing something , but I don't know what .	6

Give me that !	1

Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law .	1

In six months , we'll have the finest drill team in the world .	2

Fucking cannibal .	1

Barney ! [PERSON] , what a day .	2

I got a hunch [PERSON] ain't got his mind on his business .	1

Neighbors like each other , speak to each other , care if anybody lives or dies .	1

I'd really like to help you .	8

Because I'm still tired .	6

But at least try my way first .	1

You know , you're expecting too much from that formula of B - 4 , Mr Oxly .	1

I like doing business with a man I can trust .	8

I get to live in a place ... it's OK . Don't get me wrong . The air is clean .	4

That's great , eh ?	5

That does it .	1

I don't want her hurt at all .	6

Yours ?	8

What ? !	7

It was a pleasure to have the general here .	5

If it's new committee assignments you'd like , we can certainly arrange that .	2

Look , your mother is here .	8

We've had wonderful times , we three .	5

We should celebrate this with a bottle of wine .	2

I find it really insulting that you assume it has to be a guy .	1

But it's not real .	6

For God's sake , listen to me !	1

Look what I found !	2

She must've struck something .	6

I appreciate that , sir .	8

Boys forget what their country means by just reading  Land of the Free  in history books .	6

If only you knew how anxious I am to talk to you .	8

Great view . I bet you can see all the way to the ocean from out here .	5

I couldn't do anything .	6

I shot him .	1

They hurt you any , [PERSON] ?	6

[PERSON] , this is Al.	8

Nobody can do that , ... Except you .	1

Was a [N-WORD] ?	7

What that child got to stand , the good Lord give her strength to stand .	8

Did you see that ?	7

We have a tremendous audience here At global television studios ,	2

Anyway , what's it matter to you ?	1

Look , there's something weird going on here , and I can't quite follow it .	2

But , she can be very generous sometimes .	5

It's high time I told [PERSON] a thing or two .	1

It's a deal .	8

And the only way we got of holding 'em off is by getting together .	2

I mean , all you have to do is to step aside with immense fortune .	8

Without a wind , we'll lose him !	4

This is true , [PERSON] .	8

It will happen , as it does for all of us .	8

It affects her every day .	5

You're the first good thing that's happened to us .	7

We'll make the deal .	8

Outstanding .	5

I do not know what you are , but you are not a woman .	1

Listen , I really can't talk about this over the phone .	1

Where were you ?	7

I don't give a damn .	1

I don't know . We just ... became friends . And then it became more than that .	6

That'll stop him !	1

Now , the police are gonna want me to let some of you go as a sign of good faith .	2

You lose the feel of the cards when you have so much action ... day in and day out .	1

Ever since the club split up , I missed you . We all missed you .	6

Did you sleep well ?	7

C'mon , rest awhile girl .	2

As I said , sir it all depends how far we're willing to go .	8

I'm tired .	6

I've never been happier in my life .	5

Junior !	8

Well , I want to thank you and your wife for all your help .	8

We're counting on you .	8

Aren't you ever satisfied ?	1

No , no , no , no , no , I want to know what the hell is happening to me !	1

Before the bomb went off yesterday , do you recall seeing this man ?	4

I hope you'll enjoy this .	2

We'll share it .	2

So , I guess I was the lucky one .	6

I'm sorry you have to sneak out by the back way , but we must preserve a respectable front .	6

One can learn a great deal from him .	8

Don't be tricked by his devilish voice !	1

What good is it to cut off your heads ?	1

Sorry , coach .	6

Not going to do it .	1

This is nice .	5

They ain't going to expedite it for me .	4

We came outside giddy and reeling .	7

Good job .	8

I'm glad you told me about this .	5

I decline to answer your question . I decline to answer your question .	8

And I know this planet is safer because she's defending it .	8

My point is there is a protocol with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children .	2

Don't question my decisions again .	1

I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you , but I want you to tell me the truth .	1

No luck ?	6

It's tough being left out , isn't it ?	1

Don't ask me why .	1

He was very understanding .	8

She's going to die if you don't help me .	4

Now come on , you've been drinking .	3

Why did you lie to me ?	7

If you become president , would [PERSON] remain as vice president ?	8

Did you bring that guy in here ?	7

They've done things with my body and the bodies of others ...	3

I was in a really bad place .	6

Hey Pops , give me one of those crazy beers .	2

Cheers , man .	5

Yeah , are you gonna feed her ?	2

Just give me the stamp . I love you , [PERSON] , [PERSON] , [PERSON] , [PERSON] , whatever your name is .	8

So why don't you tell me a little about yourself ?	1

I'll be in my office if you need me .	8

This is long , man .	7

To me , man is a tremendous creation , an inconceivable thought .	2

You sound further away than that .	1

So , how is it you know so little about cars ?	7

We have an idea that might help .	2

[PERSON] is army from the anus up .	4

I had no right to put you through all that .	1

What's [PERSON] got to do with this ?	7

What about it ?	2

I get two bucks an hour , plus ten per cent of that goes to a bail fund .	1

Must be very good .	5

You really could be a nun ! Thanks .	8

Then when I'm good and ready , we come out with a big extra .	2

Collaborating with President [PERSON] is always a mistake .	8

Did you see what he did ?	7

Sink that longboat !	1

Thank you for asking .	8

How did you manage to get so friendly with [PERSON] ?	2

Did I hear something about jewels ?	2

Father .	7

I don't like your faces .	6

Well , now where are you going ?	2

Your back prevented you from practicing six hours a day .	2

If I don't get a room , you and your hotel are fourth on my list to be sued !	1

No worries .	6

Fracture that whole part of the world , and now we have ISIS .	2

I knew there was a story in that guy .	7

So , the ring ? - No .	1

Sing something , [PERSON] . Wonderful idea !	5

I have no basis and no standing to move forward if I did .	1

They're poorly !	2

I'll get on it first thing .	2

I am going to throw up .	2

Well , as long as you feel that way about it , the gun is yours !	8

Jesus ... - Christ on a crutch .	7

Get ready . We need you to drop something off .	2

Okay , I need you to calm down , okay ?	8

I've been having weather problems .	6

Whatever action needs to be taken to address this problem , needs to be taken .	2

I'm just following orders But don't worry	8

So , should we still listen to what Elder says ?	2

She'll talk about the Triad robbery , she'll name Case , then us .	4

But right now , I can't think of one .	6

Please . - Could you get [PERSON] a Coke , please ? - Sure .	8

What's so odd about that ?	7

What do you skin ?	2

How long has she been gone ? ! How long ?	6

I won't ever do it again , I promise .	1

I'm not kiddin' around .	1

Stay out of sight .	1

Be ready to leave on the night train for [LOCATION] .	2

Why would a dumb Polack like you think he could outsmart someone like me ?	3

I'm just fine .	8

Because she can't stand him !	6

I'm your man . Come anywhere near my old lady , I'll cut your balls off , asshole .	1

One good thing .	5

I mean , about my having this floor to go on with my babbling .	1

You took away my czar , my country , my people .	1

I asked him especially , and he told me to tell you .	8

Do you expect me to believe this ?	7

I don't think you'll be able to stand it long .	1

Well , the tall guy is not really a friend .	8

He tried to knife me .	1

Can I just leave my underwear ?	1

Well , I must say you're quite different from what I expected .	7

Get away from that wood !	1

I'm clearing out of that office everything I own .	1

I think you're all being unfair .	1

If they do come here , you will let me know ?	2

Okay . All right !	8

Not even a perhaps or a maybe ?	2

Sounds right to me . OK .	8

Beautiful . - Uh-huh . Yeah .	5

We've to get out of here and get help !	2

We'll have to hope that that's enough .	2

Mr. [PERSON] ? You all right ?	8

We lost [PERSON] !	6

You are a class - A fuck - up , you know ?	1

Something I can do to help you ?	8

I saw those guys coming towards [PERSON]'s house just before we got out .	2

I mean you're gonna find it kind of hard to drive without any keys .	2

I'm gonna do it now .	2

Not me .	1

You're sure of that , are you ?	8

On !	1

How many times have I told you to keep away from my desk ?	1

I'm coming to you .	8

He'll know how to handle things .	8

What about us ?	4

Don't you believe it .	1

You named it .	7

Your gutless hide is safe .	3

How does he end his letter ?	7

Here , rally round and I'll show you the points of interest .	2

I want to talk to my brothers .	2

With a ring like that I could , dare I say it , rule the world .	6

He's a good man .	8

Not your fault , don't think that .	1

And ten minutes later I got the call ... that the court had found in our favor .	8

What kind of car ?	7

You conning him out of the deed without putting down a cent .	1

Yeah , you fucking coward !	1

You don't have to call me Father .	1

Listen , I got an idea .	2

Isn't this the same desk ... ?	1

Please . Understand I was taken by surprise .	4

No , sir .	1

Press down on her !	1

So you don't know what happened .	1

May success follow your flag .	8

I'd like you to meet a friend of mine .	2

I think it was fun and sexy .	5

lmprovise .	7

Please just look at me .	4

Boss , you think of everything .	1

Are we ?	2

Well , I will be very glad to hear it .	5

I like her .	5

I don't need marked cards to beat you , pal .	1

He'll show you when it's finished .	2

She was worried about you .	4

A little early for Christmas shopping , ain't it ?	5

You'll never get me to give this up !	1

It's not exactly the Ritz , but it's peaceful and quiet .	6

You little spying ' hyena . Did the professor put you up to this ?	3

Sort of .	7

You make me sick when you speak , [PERSON] .	3

But we've got to take a closer look at this big boy .	2

The best , smartest , most interesting women in the world ?	8

No need to worry , son .	6

Come on , it's me , [PERSON] .	2

Why would anyone recognize me ?	7

So what do we do about the hostage situation , sir ?	4

You broke your husband out of prerelease ?	1

What the blaze is going on here ?	7

I hate that cheap little bastard .	3

But , of course , she's lying .	3

Well , it can't be helped now .	6

Very nice , [PERSON] .	5

And treat those two impostors Just the same ...  	5

You know this guy !	8

It just makes me feel real glad to see the Chiefs back on the warpath again ... to coin a phrase .	5

Is this the kind of person that you are ?	2

No , I think it's a lot more exciting than that .	2

It doesn't fear my incantations !	4

We should go .	2

Mister , is this Heaven here or not ?	1

Hey , they're ... they're shutting the door .	4

Can't you humor him ? I need a favor .	1

You still serve that dull , grey stupidity .	3

Don't you understand ?	1

Specialist to the nursery .	1

I think [PERSON] was kind of cute .	5

Put it down	1

We got to find [PERSON] .	2

Everything's gonna be okay .	8

Who's got time to wonder what happened to some ridiculous talking mice when you're driving by at 75 , miles an hour ?	7

I was state - raised ... and this is a dead place .	6

Keep it down , you'll wake the munchkins !	1

I wouldn't be stupid enough to bring it home .	1

We'll let him sleep .	1

It pretends this man is in danger when no one cares about him one bit .	4

He doesn't have your heart .	6

You take care of these people .	8

They screwed him up .	1

Why did you take him then with me ?	7

Whether we live or die may depend on what happens here .	4

He knows , what I do not understand it is for what reason the Inglethorp it seemed so interested in being a prisoner .	1

The three so - called flying saucers had been recovered in [LOCATION] .  	6

You know I told you that [PERSON] and I are going to get married ... when he comes back from the maneuvers .	1

I hope to see more of you , when you're free of the spell of Mr. [PERSON] .	2

What did he say ?	7

That's part of the picture .	7

Are you crying ?	6

Well , I can't help wondering if [PERSON] is right .	4

Stand by and see his wife insulted ?	1

I was thinking of picking up a pizza and going home .	2

Ah ! - You should listen to your brother .	1

Now you can show Papa some of them tricks .	2

I'll see to it .	2

What's weak about wanting ?	6

And we're finished playing the key cities .	2

Yes , sir .	8

I didn't mean to offend you . I was just being me , you know ?	7

I've been doing some checking on you , Mr. [PERSON] .	1

( isaac crying ) - it's cranky time .	6

bat - blind ships .	7

You're the busiest woman I ever saw .	7

How could he , A young , inexperienced priest , Do battle alone with the dark lord himself ?	2

And don't forget , there are two things that have no limit :	1

You look different .	2

Good heavens , isn't there any revolt in you ?	7

Just get the head .	1

Drop that gun and let me walk out .	1

Just let me take her back with me .	1

She'll listen to you , you're not her mother .	1

You could change decent and decent . Go straight .	8

It's wasted on this bunch of Swiss bankers .	1

Actually , I kissed you because I couldn't control myself	6

Whatever I lost , I lost a long time ago , and I don't plan on losing more .	6

Next time remind me to bring some aspirin .	2

Everybody's a screwball in some way .	8

Sorry for the slight inconvenience , Your Honor .	6

They threatened to kill me if I didn't pay .	4

Hey , daddy's friends are here .	5

What are you talking about , dad ,	2

I'm trusting you to be discreet .	8

Move , I tell you .	8

All killed ?	4

Looking for [PERSON] ?	2

Now , this is pretty great .	5

Yes , of course .	2

[PERSON] said she couldn't go out tonight , so I said she could use the parlour .	6

Something wrong ?	4

What do you call it ?	1

Give it to me !	1

I don't think you should drive .	1

So , we have bought a little time to locate [PERSON] .	2

Certainly you would give any information you had on a case ... To your investigating staff ? Certainly .	1

Okay , everybody out . The party's over .	2

I want some orange juice , eggs , bacon , toasted muffin and lots of coffee .	2

They saw something they weren't supposed to see .	7

So , don't try any funny business .	1

No , you can't leave , you're like the coolest thing about this place .	1

Hope that some help comes .	2

you ever make me look stupid , you're dead .	1

I'm telling you , this cocksucker's trouble .	1

Don't make me shoot you .	1

What a waste of talent .	3

Everything else stops ...	1

How did you do that ?	7

It concerns me !	1

Last night was not so good .	6

I'm afraid I've disappointed you .	6

They were wonderful .	5

That sounds worse than it was .	6

Which future has God , if there is a God , chosen for man's destiny ?	2

What does Molto have to do with this ?	7

That don't do us any good .	4

I'm glad she's on my side .	5

If he starts convincing those senators , you might as well blow your brains out !	1

Your refusal to speak to me is tediously immature , [PERSON] .	2

Here ... the Revolution started .	2

Darn it , [PERSON] .	8

I think [PERSON] does make sense .	8

How about that ? Hey , you're pretty handy to have around , kid .	5

Bingo . You've got a right to open your collar , take off your shoes and relax in [LOCATION] for the rest of your life .	8

I think I'll be just fine .	8

I'll fix you something to eat and call [PERSON] and tell him we're not coming .	2

â™ª On nights like this with the moon above â™ª	5

One cop per car ?	4

Well , I'll fly down to [LOCATION] in the morning and feel them out .	2

Get out of my office .	1

l 'm in love with this baby that I'm carrying . 	5

That you don't want to live here , or in [LOCATION] , or [LOCATION] , or any other place where people have to live on top of each other , and they don't have enough room to walk , or breath , or smile .	1

How you doing , cowboy ?	7

You won something , did you ?	8

I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again .	1

From this moment it is death to him who wears the ring .	6

Are you drinking my coolers ?	3

That's good . He's bringing his grandson . He's grooming him to take over .	8

You mean you haven't even heard from him ?	7

You seem easily impressed by numbers , captain .	7

Might wash some of the starch out of you , or rust .	3

What are you gonna do there ?	7

The ship's packed with Muslim pilgrims , which could present a hostage situation .	4

General , our discoveries will change the outcome of the war .	2

It was a gift from an admirer who said I was always late .	5

It ... it's gonna be okay .	8

Did you light the hearth in my room ?	7

Yes .	2

Willie , you look worried .	4

Birth of some issues right there .	8

So how can you tell the difference ?	2

That's why it's a good idea to get boys out of the crowded cities for a couple of months of the year .	2

We think we got our Jack the Ripper .	8

The show goes on in five minutes !	2

How about it , kid ?	2

Well , that's good to hear .	5

There are you , free to come and go as you please , and you choose to stay here .	8

A man who would come here as a virgin .	2

I know how much that hurts .	6

You want to know what a real criminal is , [PERSON] ?	2

But you were never there for me , Dad .	6

Mayday !	7

I'd like to see the rest of the guns now .	2

I've missed you .	6

What did you say , you bow - tied freak ?	7

But it's very good !	5

It looks ridiculous with that coat he's got on .	3

How romantic .	5

Who do you think you're punishing , huh ?	7

Bloody woman .	1

I'm warning you ...	1

Well , I'm here to have a dialogue .	2

And denied .	1

At bottom she's a very dull girl and the life she pictures for herself is the life she belongs in .	6

When you can see into this crystal , then you will be ready .	2

I don't want to get shot .	4

Don't worry about a thing .	4

She'd come back , soaked to the skin , but always with the same excuse :	1

Meaning what ?	7

We're getting a lot of heat from parents ' groups .	2

Have a good day , honey .	5

How could you let her do a thing like this ? What ?	7

[PERSON] , executive producer of Kitchen Sink and now , L.A. Beat .	4

Fucking bitch !	1

Did you have a warrant to search his trunk ?	7

Remember how white and fluffy she used to be after I gave her a bath ?	5

I think you really love me .	5

I have to go to rehearsals .	2

Well done !	8

Wouldn't this be faster ?	1

It's a wonder we make a profit at all .	7

Have you been drinking ?	3

You better be home tonight , you [GAY SLUR] .	3

You had plain , decent , everyday common rightness .	7

Oh tots , I'll keep that in mind .	2

He ever , uh ... touch you ?	8

Terror tactics , man .	7

We're going to raise towers of glass and steel .	2

You don't understand .	1

You wan na teach me how to handle my own daughter ?	8

Because you talked me into this , that's why , you idiot !	1

No , let's not risk it . OK .	4

I got troubles of my own .	6

If you know where she is , I beg you to tell me now before it's too late .	6

If you ask me , this is the worst case of downright rudeness I've seen .	6

I thought he didn't drink .	7

You're sorry ?	6

Altitude !	7

It's nothing . - Nothing at all .	6

You can not come to the hospital , [LOCATION] .	6

It's an amazing place . I really like coming here .	5

I just got this brainstorm in the middle of the night and ... funny how that happens sometimes .	2

But you can't .	1

You can't even call ? We'll be stashed away .	1

I'm blowing this place .	8

You murdered your own god , by accident .	3

Thank you , Admiral [PERSON] .	8

We're talking about two minutes of film . Two minutes out of .	2

It's gonna be a treacherous hike .	2

I'm against it .	1

What about the herd ?	2

Now if we want to survive we've got to fight back , we can't hide anymore .	4

I know a lot of nice girls .	5

I'm not very good at that .	6

Look after my things .	1

I invited you .	8

No , I don't even want to do that .	1

We're prisoners of war .	4

But if you do not work hard you will be punished .	1

I wish for you to have a heart .	8

He don't get it .	1

Do not be afraid .	4

And what happens Tuesday ?	2

Let's try to figure the whole thing out .	2

I'm not scared really .	4

There is nothing I can do .	6

I mean , didn't you feel like A complete piece of gutless , spineless , Primordial slime ?	3

He's not coming back .	4

If there's any justice , let him get mugged by the man who took my watch !	2

What about the treasure ?	2

The train's slowing down . How far to the station ?	2

He's alive !	4

Your boat , my boat .	8

Then there's no hope .	6

Would there still be a court file on this case ?	1

I won't vote on it until I get my questions answered .	1

They're gonna need a fucking wrecking ball to take me out of here .	1

I need something something that can fly and that can scare the pants off anything living in that castle .	4

How did [PERSON] and the newspapers get the [PERSON] story before you ?	2

Look , I ain't got no more to say to you , OK ?	1

Do you know that my first trip to [LOCATION] took five days ?	2

What you gonna do about it ?	1

I think she's pretty .	5

Their testimony would make history .	8

She was gonna turn me in .	4

I can not begin to tell you how sorry I am ... That any of this has taken place .	6

Our reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel .	1

It's not what you think . I - I - I would never ... Please , [PERSON] .	6

There never has been a [PERSON] at your hospital .	6

[PERSON] , don't do anything .	4

I'd like your opinion .	8

He went after him like ...	6

These heels are grotesque .	2

That's unacceptable .	2

Will you be blessing this house with your presence for dinner ?	2

Hey , what are you sleeping out here for ?	7

What does my height have to do with anything ?	2

You made Case feel like shit tonight 'cause he was scared .	4

I've got my own life to worry about .	6

And when you win Oscars , both of you , you'll look in the camera and thank me .	8

A hundred years from now , nobody will know the difference .	6

Just get it over with .	1

I don't want it .	1

With a baby , you never know what you're getting .	7

I said we're closed , [PERSON] .	6

It's not a role . It's a job , a rent - paying job . Now come on ;	1

[PERSON] , are you familiar with Article of Navy regulations ?	8

Um , really good to see you , ma'am .	8

I tell you , our side will always win .	8

You see , [PERSON] , this is a respectable business and there's nothing wrong with that .	1

I got the address of this [PERSON] , and I went to see her this morning . Really early .	2

Too bad the girls are in [LOCATION] .	6

Where ... ?	7

We'll have help up to you real soon .	2

What do you mean , you're downstairs , you idiot ?	1

It's home .	8

It looks different here .	5

We say who , we say when , we say how much .	2

How am I gonna get to first base with this girl ?	2

Take a vacation , let things cool off .	2

Victory over the devil . A great day for mankind .	5

And I don't care whether you go down with him or not .	1

People out there are looting the streets , robbing off hard earners , hard grafters .	6

I'm glad this happened .	5

Do you know how many people are dying ?	6

I know you don't mean any harm , but you are in everyone's way .	1

I think we should talk .	8

Well , [PERSON] will think of something .	2

There's no place out there for graft or greed or lies , or compromise with human liberties .	1

I can't believe it was you on the phone .	1

What , somebody had a saxophone ?	7

You throw double sixes again , and I'll have you burned for a witch .	1

I'll be glad to do it .	5

Why , [PERSON] , it was my idea to give a party for [PERSON] .	2

Fight for real !	1

We sent the messages !	2

He'll have to be committed ....	8

Father , is it all over ?	8

Do Russians never think about life ?	6

[PERSON] , can you hear me ?	2

Fine . You win .	5

Glad to see you .	5

You better talk to her now .	8

I needed it .	8

It was damn stupid of me , wasn't it ?	1

I know you'll take good care of it .	8

And let me remind you , we lost two key PA's in one day .	6

[PERSON] , it's me . - Yeah .	8

I need you so much .	8

The whole world sucks .	1

Um ... I'm always getting myself into these kinds of things .	2

We give no quarter to those that are disloyal .	1

Yeah , I dreamt about trains .	7

Were you together ? Yeah .	7

When the war's over , [PERSON] .	2

For chrissake , where did she come up with [PERSON] ?	2

Who the hell are you to ask all these questions ?	1

Boy , wait'll they see what we found .	2

It's great , Meat , it's great .	5

He disappeared a long time ago .	6

Maybe they're buddies after all .	4

I could take care of you , [PERSON] , if you'd let me .	8

You'll never mean anything but misery to any man .	6

He's enjoying it ! Can't you see he's enjoying it ?	5

You're here to repent your sins , is it ?	3

You're doing great .	5

I got nothin' to lose .	6

Go to bed at night happy and then murdered .	5

The bite ... was mine .	1

It's all so horrible , isn't it ?	6

I don't have to get any place but out . Share a cab ?	1

I fancy something a bit sporty . - That one .	5

Call it off , [PERSON] .	1

So you and me are gonna make a little arrangement .	2

Honey , it's nice to have somebody take care of you .	5

She had my finger , you know ...	1

Perhaps this was the one step too far .	4

[PERSON] , you trust me , don't you ?	8

I think my cessna is safer anytime .	4

Look , we don't need him .	4

Make us a cup of tea , [PERSON] .	2

Oh , that's what you're working on ?	2

I'll keep her off the screen . I'll destroy her . No .	1

I know we can work through the petty stuff .	1

Oh Mr. [PERSON] , everything ok ?	4

If I didn't know better , I'd think you didn't like it here .	7

Emily , why are you still using your mother's phone ?	1

It kills many brave men .	4

See ? See ? See ?	2

I view with alarm the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady .	4

I want you to be on fucking guard , man .	1

May I help you ?	8

With the speechwriting , I don't want to do it anymore .	1

I'm gonna get that bastard .	1

You say you're sorry and we'll let you go .	6

The ponies were dying .	6

I've decided to go to [LOCATION] , just like I made it up in a story .	2

Merry Christmas .	5

All right , gentlemen . Stand by .	1

You know , with them new suits they're makin' , I bet they helping ' the sun tan oil sales ... all that skin to cover .	8

[PERSON] ? What kind of a name is that ?	7

Senator [PERSON] decided this with you ?	8

[PERSON] knew his way around the old neighbourhoods .	7

Well , I sure do appreciate you boys busting me out .	8

If I thought you were the slightest bit interested , I would .	1

Give me the suit , right now .	1

We'll owe her .	8

That is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard in my life .	1

Wait ! His troops are still out there	2

Now she's going back today , soon as we give 'em a full stomach to travel on .	2

Mind if we ask who the hell you are ?	1

You're a detective now ?	8

When does it happen ? When ?	2

That butcher , Eggers , he'll take 35 , head ... and butcher them himself .	1

One last thing . If you could return this to [PERSON]'s for me , please ?	8

I can pull it out and let you take a whip _ if you'd like .	2

Oh , I'm sure it was just a nightmare .	4

What if you have to back to the castle ?	2

Look , is there someplace that we could go and talk ?	2

You know how it is .	2

Banks today have got to be careful .	4

Who says ? - It's just so , [PERSON] !	7

A hundred of these are produced every day and sent to sweatshops where urban slaves prepare this poison for our friends , our loved ones , our children .	2

Cheers .	5

You mean I can't have me no credit to grow me no crop this year ?	6

â™ª Happy blessings to you God blessings to you â™ª	5

Don't tell [PERSON] this .	1

[PERSON] did everything he could , but they got away .	6

You really believe you can frighten me ?	7

What a surprise to see you .	2

Maybe you're sorry you married me now , [PERSON] .	6

But you still haven't answered me .	6

I'm not gonna give him any help unless he needs it .	1

It's been an honor to serve with you .	8

Oh , don't say that !	1

That's - that's very kind of you . I hope that you and your wife were - were not uncomfortable .	3

I remembered why I loved paintings in the first place , what got me into this .	5

Oh my God ! You totally should .	1

I'm going to have to leave the country if I ever want a breath of air .	2

Do something with yourself for pity's sakes .	1

If you want him to die , shoot now .	4

Who you think you're messing with , you dumb animal ?	3

That's no way to remember him .	6

You must tell me a few of them .	1

How dare you , you ... How long has she been in this condition ?	7

Also , I don't like nobody touching me .	6

This is a whole new world to me .	2

Yeah , I'd love a cold beer .	2

As you know , over here , crime is not exploited to sell newspapers .	1

Yeah , a beer , please .	2

And what she did was she ... Brought her into a life of hell .	1

I must go .	2

Come here , quick !	2

Yeah , I think you would be decent , With all that account balance bullshit .	1

I don't see myself in one of those bullshit nine - to - five jobs .	1

I knew there'd be a catch to this .	8

You can't arrest me here .	1

It was terrible . He screamed with fear .	4

If you , Miss [PERSON] , know of any proof about aliens , you can give it to me and I guarantee you I will get it out , but I am skeptical .	8

[PERSON] , what's the most recent communication we've received ?	2

Violence prone , obsessive / compulsive personality , a history of excessive physical force throughout his years as a [LOCATION] police officer .	1

You're a month early for the book fair .	8

[PERSON] says he didn't rent a car . The rental company says he did . Whatever .	1

Now that particular statement really pissed me off , because I don't think Congress did any such thing .	1

Will succeed .	2

I just came over to share my happiness with you , [PERSON] .	5

And we take care of our own here .	8

Hey , I'm a mama .	5

Don't bother to get up I'll take care of myself	1

Easy .	8

We have so much .	8

Pecmans ? Buttissimo ? Ah , the old abba dabbas	7

One more word and I'll cut you down !	1

He was very clever , so it was very hard to find out about .	5

I promise you that .	8

If that's true ... this should be very exciting .	2

You know what I'll do in the morning ?	2

I want to hear everything you've been doing .	2

[PERSON] is with [PERSON] .	8

Did you hear that , honey ?	7

Can't shoot a kid , can you , fucker ?	1

You don't get the truth in the Senate .	1

We don't want none of his gratitude !	1

You are a coward like all other people , aren't you ?	3

They say it is the skin of a dead snake .	4

Jesus . Yes , this is me .	4

She's got a witch's brain .	4

Can I get you a drink ?	2

I wan na go home .	2

I carried you in here when you were a baby .	8

We could pick it up on the way home .	2

Way too much weird stuff goes on here .	3

I'm gonna be good , you wait .	2

Mind out , cuz .	1

The usual , sir ?	8

Oh , he ain't alone .	4

Take him !	1

He was here ?	7

How was [LOCATION] ?	2

Do you see how this affects [PERSON] ? You don't ?	1

We won't leave this palace alive .	4

You stupid lizard ! Get off me !	1

The girl you thought you knew was quite nameless and without reality .	7

Hello , sweet thing .	5

It's not right . I'm gonna go check it out .	4

They're harmless , friendly , and , by all reports , extremely intelligent and sophisticated .	5

As he waves to the crowd , you can hear the tremendous cheer !	2

My God , she's coming inside . Oh , God .	4

I don't want to start rehashing everything .	6

But it's bleeding ?	4

Hey , no !	1

We'll catch 'em sooner or later .	2

Get us some frickin' pretzels or something .	2

Am I , [PERSON] ? - No .	1

That's much better .	5

He was generous .	8

It was no self - defense , [PERSON] took him out .	1

He was a loser too .	6

You get your ass over there , Gate .	1

What did he tell you to tell me ?	7

Is it , perhaps , that this cause is too hopeless ?	6

Bathing suits looked awfully funny 100 , years ago .	7

You sleep in till noon , then you watch [LOCATION] and Bullwinkle .	2

What'll it be ?	2

[PERSON]'s depending on you , [PERSON] .	2

I know you're all right ... and a good woman at heart , even though you might have took a wrong turn in life .	1

Well , I reckon I'm in .	5

Out ! Get out !	1

We throw ourselves at your mercy .	4

We thought you'd be safer on the ground .	8

Just put me through on the phone , [PERSON] . Goddamn it !	1

I'm cold .	6

Since you're their representatives , I can tell you that I'm prepared , right now , to give you a [PERSON] .	8

The belle from hell Versus the dove from above In a one - soul , anything goes match - up , [PERSON] .	1

Come say hello to [PERSON] . Have you met ?	2

Go get him , Dad !	1

What the fuck ? !	1

There were bodies that were involved with some of these crashes .	4

He's taken it again !	8

With this strike they've no way home , and there's not a room in the city .	1

Still working on my dissertation at my age . It's ridiculous .	1

If you think I'm the kind to mess with anybody comes along ...	1

I'm afraid of you ?	4

The Kid will have to play him .	2

They have a craving for human flesh .	3

He wants clean people on the screen for himself and his children to look at .	2

Don't give me that . I know enough about weights and measures to know holes aren't allowed , no corrective holes .	1

[PERSON]'s people were ready to go , but the FSB replaced the crew .	2

Get the hell up because I'm out here alone .	1

Are you out of your mind ?	1

I'll break it to her gently .	1

Background , [PERSON] . Tell me about it .	1

Freeze !	1

Hop on , no time to lose .	1

I'm going to be next week .	2

See anything you like ?	2

What kind of a deal is this ?	2

I know about abnormal behaviour .	3

We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange .	2

I love the smell of commerce in the morning !	5

That is ridiculous .	1

Yeah , she'll wind up fat , alcoholic and miserable .	6

What other reason could there be ?	2

Remote and useful .	5

I change cars like other guys change their fuckin' shoes !	1

And now , a happy surprise for all of us .	5

Time's over for drifters and outlaws and those who got no backbone .	2

You're going to Harvard and you're gonna be a doctor .	4

I think there's a lot of planets out there .	2

I told you not to count it .	1

For the hospital , for the seriously sick .	4

I got a surprise for you tonight .	2

Look how big it is !	2

I want them booked on felony charges , destruction of private property , and assault .	1

We are witnessing the making of a legend , [PERSON] , the kind of thing that front covers are made of .	2

The most beautiful TV personality , Miss [PERSON] !	5

I had fights ... . . and every one of 'em I was scared , so yeah , you know , that's real , real normal .	4

You will pay me back what you owe , with interest .	8

Come right in .	2

Very nice of him , though .	5

Yes , I noticed you'd packed .	2

Well , actually ...	5

Get that piece of pigshit out here .	1

Dear Senator , have you got any idea what it takes to get a bill passed ?	2

I want some more beer .	2

There will come a time , when those who sit above me will want you delivered .	2

That night I got a grip on life again .	4

She's fainted .	2

Put them back .	1

Tell me the whole story from the beginning .	2

At my age , you got ta think about retiring .	2

It felt good .	5

That's why your wife dumped you .	1

Liar !	1

[PERSON]'s going to help with my chemistry .	8

I've never known anyone as capable and intelligent .	8

It's out ! - Are you all right ?	8

Take that sentence back !	1

He reached out to us and asked if we'd be willing to help him	2

[PERSON] , I can't subpoena those records without a legitimate client .	1

My back's giving me hell .	1

[PERSON] won't see her kids again .	4

He hit me .	4

Your beloved business manager , [PERSON] the man you stayed with , the one I begged you to leave ....	1

Put this on .	1

You think I like playing sick little games with you ?	6

I am broke , desperate and very pissed .	6

If [PERSON] found out , it would kill her .	4

( sighs ) I thought I got some good news .	6

I warn you , if this case comes to trial , it will be before a French court .	4

Consuella is right .	8

But the water was dangerously low ?	4

Just feel how nice it is in here .	5

And as for taxes , how many millions have you in tax - exempt bonds and oil wells , whose power of production your government so generously protects , while it denies similar benefits to the human brain ?	3

How come she leave that job ?	1

Oh , very good !	5

I was getting a message for you .	8

I think it's brilliant .	5

You taught me everything .	8

Particularly child trafficking .	8

I'm so sorry .	6

[PERSON] , you must be mistaken .	4

When we first went there , [PERSON] , he could barely speak .	6

We've been through this !	7

The only ones who see a UFO on TV programs are the rednecks .	4

Why , her last words were about you .	7

Home team .	1

I just wish I could tell him how much I appreciate this .	6

You can hold the frog .	2

Let's sing !	2

He says he doesn't want presents , but you know him .	6

Christ .	7

With who ?	7

A man dropped you off unconscious . Who ?	1

I was afraid of that .	4

[PERSON] asked me if I wanted to see him again .	2

Let's get something to eat .	2

How can you have the gall to compare the conflict here in [LOCATION] with a glass of cappuccino coffee ?	1

I was getting lonely upstairs , all by myself .	6

I'll speak with you first .	2

Allow me to get that bag for you .	8

So the basic problem is that I'm still around ?	8

Everyone wanted to do the oral argument , that's always kind of the cherry on top of the ice cream there .	2

[PERSON]'s divorce left him in a state of disorder .	6

Pick you up in an hour .	8

I told you , this can get tough .	8

They'll destroy you .	4

Four degrees down !	7

Here , at least , I'm a little star .	6

Any day now the doctors say they may find the antitoxin .	2

These little rascals make life worth living .	8

I would put money on us .	8

Wasn't [PERSON] the sweetest man you ever met ?	5

I wish I were a woman of 36 , dressed in black satin with a string of pearls .	3

They say some of us can turn as late as nine or ten , but I'm past that now so ...	2

Good luck , [PERSON] .	8

I never thought of it ...	6

I'll talk to you later .	2

I do better with women , and they don't eat cigars ...	2

It will be a fine thing to do .	8

Like a velvet glove cast in iron , and like the gas chamber , [PERSON] , a real fun gal .	5

A wonderful day , I think .	5

It's as true now as it was then .	7

I have something I'd like to show you .	2

Bless you . Father , how can I possibly thank you ?	8

[PERSON] , is you going out of your mind ?	1

Jeanne !	4

You can beat it out of me , but it won't do you any good .	8

You and I are such similar creatures .	8

What's this about a film ?	2

We're partnering on a project .	2

It's a big nut to crack .	4

You have to have faith .	8

The Presidential Commission has empowered me to take it in my care .	8

Unless you wanted me to stay .	1

Isn't this exciting ?	5

Men will believe anything , the more preposterous the better .	8

That hurts .	6

Nothing we didn't expect .	6

Let me handle your husband's career and you can live like human beings again .	8

I don't care what you found , boy !	1

The pretty one on the right . I think she likes you .	5

You can hardly expect the jury to believe that a woman in love doesn't attempt to meet her lover .	6

Yes , I confess .	8

Fine .	5

Then you must be his ...	8

I've always thought a lashing with a whip would benefit you immensely .	7

I need to know .	2

Well , young man , you seem to be enjoying yourself .	5

Well , there it is .	2

We've got to leave .	2

That would be nice .	5

This sure is a happy day to me .	5

I hope you lose .	1

I will not go back where I came from , because I do not like it there .	1

Would you call me [PERSON] ?	2

And that's exactly what I'm going to do .	2

There is no other way out , my friend .	6

He was the sanest man I ever knew .	6

You ain't really gonna let them take that baby , are you ?	1

Nobody's on it because she's a junkie , and everything she said to me is in the Lucas Goodwin manifesto , which has been picked apart by every message board and conspiracy theorist on the Internet .	1

I think we're stuck .	4

I thought , l 'm in love . 	5

Keep joshing like that And you're never going to college like your sister here .	1

I know the answer .	8

I know you were deeply touched by [PERSON]'s gesture ,	8

I'd known [PERSON] since I was an altar boy .	8

You a fifty - dollar whore ? - What are you doing ?	3

More importantly , what the hell am I doing here ?	1

[PERSON] , they weren't taking any chances !	4

Now , with such simplicity ... Such clarity , everything falls into place .	8

Help me .	8

We should get rid of anybody that doesn't put the company first .	4

You know , [PERSON] is not gonna last five minutes out there .	1

You look tired , Little Big Man .	6

Right . And the living room nose and the kitchen forehead and den ears .	3

Sir , I was the best swimmer in my course .	8

That might not be the worst of it .	6

I'm a fighter .	8

Fire the security department !	4

You don't care whether I live or die .	1

[PERSON] was the fireball of our little cocoon .	8

Hell , we could bring in the whole god damn New York Knicks just to make sure your trash hits the basket ! How's that ?	1

I just can't believe [PERSON]'s dead .	6

[PERSON] , do you know what you're saying ?	1

I know you're trying to scare me , huh ?	4

You okay ?	8

You do , you look amazing , isabel .	5

Get out of my way , [PERSON] .	1

Mr. [PERSON] , you wan na join the party ?	2

Something hit us .	4

Stand by to torpedo !	1

He told you to tell me that too ?	1

Now , today ...	2

Harry , how did you do it ?	7

Old man , my last name isn't Chow !	7

The Lady herself Inglethorp !	7

I want you to know how sorry I am I had to put you through this .	6

No , no , no .	1

You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day ?	7

I think I'm going to go back in and see the movie .	2

Therefore , it must be a metal .	6

No , don't ! Not this one .	1

Nothing will ever happen to me anymore !	6

You're going into the arena alone .	1

I thought I liked to party , but these guys ...	5

I don't give a shit if he knows who killed him or not .	1

You tell him I've got [PERSON] under control .	1

You won't get away with this , Trixie .	1

Is she the one in the painting ?	7

He must be going out of his mind .	1

The good people of [LOCATION] !	5

And , [PERSON] , I want you to get me the CEO of IBC ASAP .	2

It seems there's no formal contract between you and [LOCATION] .	6

I'm glad you're making new friends .	5

The Montauk Club , : pm .	2

I didn't marry her under my real name .	6

[PERSON] , my sympathy for your loss --	6

Sucker !	1

We're not gonna hurt you .	4

The police have road blocks on every main exit from town .	4

It's a nice sentimental gesture , CinCPac sending your old cruiser .	5

I had the most frightening experience .	6

It sounds frightening .	2

Something is breeding there . Underneath the cemetery .	4

There's the finest deerskin jacket I've ever seen .	5

I couldn't agree with you more .	6

It'd be a big help if you could keep an area clear in front of the bridge for us .	2

I couldn't get the cook on such short notice , so we're on our own .	1

You think you know something about law .	7

l 'm in love with a cop from the . 	5

[PERSON] needed my help .	8

It's better than dying in some dirty hotel .	3

The idea that Backpage is just trying to cater to fetishes of old men , doesn't really involve underage children ,	6

[PERSON] is a man of luck .	8

Don't lose a moment .	4

Yes , but when the cash runs out , they'll mob us .	4

Stand here and argue .	1

You said you'd never leave me .	6

[PERSON] , keep that mule's asshole away from me before I have to break him .	1

Oh , I am sorry .	6

All my failings were preparations for meeting you .	2

His ambition has jeopardized the prosperity of the English people .	1

It's like working in a filling station , watching the cars go by .	2

What's he doing there ?	7

Are you guys nuts ?	7

Sure .	8

Today's just taking shit down .	1

Once again skill and daring have overcome fear and anxiety .	4

Take your hands off there , you old fool .	3

You ain't gonna take no car .	1

Fucking come on , then !	1

It's over . Water under the bridge .	8

The Feds are at the lake house , man .	4

Don't leave without saying goodbye .	6

You want fantasy , let's go to my place .	2

A river patrol just fished a girl out of the water .	2

Like hell it isn't .	1

No way [PERSON] is going to talk me into cutting celery again .	1

I don't want to lose you .	1

Don't go to him in anger . Go and warn him .	4

Ah , the ring !	7

What am I gonna do , [PERSON] ?	2

Give me all the covering fire you can spare .	1

Are you willing to take that chance ?	8

Here we go again !	2

You can't leave me here alone .	1

You should have learned by now !	8

I could sure use your help .	8

She was a hooker and made it sound so great .	5

What is it now ?	2

If you have something to say , say it and get out .	1

That's what I pay you for .	1

[PERSON] , why are you so cross ?	7

We're unbeatable .	2

I behaved abominably .	3

They're meeting my first demand .	2

Fucking asshole . I love you .	1

All the good in this world came from fools with faith like that .	3

I cast thee back to hell . To hell !	1

I'll get in trouble !	4

I'm sorry I can't wait here with you , but ...	6

The wise man gets drunk to spend his time with fools .	3

Okay , then let's get going .	2

Why don't you both shut up ?	1

What are you doing ? - Shh .	7

Father . I'm seeing a pattern here .	2

There has seldom been a man so unwise , so headstrong but he could see the necessity of keeping friends and not making enemies at court .	1

Thank you . Good night .	5

Let him go !	1

Let's go get them , baby .	2

Can I ask you something ?	2

Don't nobody want to ask me nothin' ?	1

Have Doc take a look at him .	2

Well , my mother was a music teacher and married my father , whose family was extremely wealthy .	8

You know , I'm getting damn tired of your misplaced admiration .	1

Why don't you shut the hell up ! Crybaby .	1

When will you come back to me ?	2

I don't want to go to [LOCATION] .	6

I - I came to this country to pursue the American dream .	2

Excuse me , Doctor , but that would be a tragic mistake .	6

Can't do what ?	1

They breed like rabbits , don't do any work and expect Welfare to put them on [LOCATION] .	1

I have no idea what to do .	1

[PERSON] , thanks ever so much .	5

I'm going after her .	2

Well , she did sort of embrace it once she did .	1

No , that's not it , give me that chain .	1

It's ... it's gonna take me a while to map out all of her movements .	2

This is [PERSON] , Chief of Homicide Bureau Office of the District Attorney , County of [LOCATION] .	1

As you can see , I'm being relieved of command .	6

Since you're sitting in the corner . You're usually a power table kind of girl .	3

I need to send my thumbprint so they know it's me .	2

You put asses into seats .	3

Please come back , [PERSON] .	2

The best !	8

So , are you going to tell the police ?	4

It's nice to have company for tea .	5

Would you like to dance ?	2

You can't do this to him , or to all the others .	1

Quiet , please !	8

You treat her bad .	3

He got a little sick .	6

[PERSON] turns against me , And I should lighten up ?	8

I don't think I should join your campaign , you know .	1

As for me , I'm just a slave .	1

I'm thinking , I did it .	1

What do you want it to be ?	2

Would you like me to go back and get [PERSON] out ?	2

All that money , [PERSON] ?	1

I wanted to surprise you .	2

You look terrific .	5

Nothing's impossible .	6

I just don't fit behind a desk , I I'm not cut out for it , I feel dry - docked .	1

Oh , no . Come on . You don't know that .	1

That's excellent .	5

You must have had some wonderful experiences in [LOCATION] .	5

He's a bit soft that Inspector , isn't he ?	3

The man ends up looking like his heart attacked him .	3

All you got ta do is run into him .	1

It can only blow up in our faces .	6

I've been missing you a lot lately .	6

Well , I'd say the [LOCATION] money will probably lay about ... oh , 8 - 5 , on [PERSON] .	2

I'm renting a fucking bed - sit , Al.	1

You knew when I point blank asked you , and you lied to me about it .	1

I can't keep this from the president any longer .	1

You don't look excited .	5

You know I'm gonna be the president , right ?	8

I am ready , Mr. [PERSON] .	2

By the time they take the mortgage payments out of my paycheck , there's not enough left to buy you a fuckin' box of tampons !	1

Yeah , I um , I just ... just thought I saw something , but I can't really , um , trust my eyes these days .	6

You murdering fool !	3

Tomorrow , [PERSON] ... My friend and mentor , will testify he thinks I'm guilty .	8

You'll learn quick enough .	8

He is unworthy of command .	8

No , stay there . You must stay .	1

Don't move !	1

Bastards .	1

Will she be back soon ?	2

He's worse than [PERSON] Tex.	6

You got me down in this goddamn water .	1

I don't get your generation's humour .	1

You want us to believe that ?	2

No , you're not listening to me !	1

One time he had the whole cast over from some [LOCATION] show .	2

Well , like I said , right now , I've got a bigger problem .	4

Come on , damn it !	1

What's that got to do with us ?	7

What's your hurry , honey ? He's not gonna run away !	4

No , but he's not feeling well .	6

But we will be still more intelligent .	2

This test may tell us why .	1

That money was going to change my life .	6

So , you're a lawyer now ?	1

It's a dead man .	6

He won't open the safe .	4

I have something inevitable to tell you .	8

I ain't gonna call her any more .	1

I want everything he's got .	2

You can call it an immigration if you want to , [PERSON] .	2

He wasn't worthy of your loyalty .	8

Wouldn't you enjoy that ?	5

All right . Mind your shoving ' , mate .	2

I want to talk to you .	8

Are you able to offer something ?	2

You chickenshit bastard .	3

I can't have that .	1

We know from our fancy telescopes that just in the last years , more than planets have been identified outside our solar system that seem to be far enough from their suns and dense enough that they might be able to support	6

That means we're in grave trouble .	4

Fuck your goddamn cleaner !	1

Yes , I guess it's been a nightmare for you too .	4

I don't have casual affairs .	1

I will .	2

Knows him real well .	8

Bring him to me !	1

In other words , it doesn't hurt a bit .	6

And how about some pepper and salt and vinegar , eh ?	2

I'm a friend of the family .	8

I've got some sandwiches in my pack .	2

Ring it , mate .	2

I'm an actor , see ?	2

Such an honour that you rode my horse !	8

He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens and you with it !	1

Give me a nice big hug , like you used to when you were little .	5

Holy Moses .	7

What was that crack ?	7

Your day is done , old boy .	8

But I'm expecting a courier any minute .	2

How sad .	6

I love this !	5

Because we've lived through it .	5

I bet you don't even like girls , do you ?	1

[PERSON] , you're so ... weird !	7

It seems to me very clear .	4

Now , if Case doesn't kill us , the Triads will .	4

Well , I no longer wish to buy your company and take it apart . I don't want anyone else to either .	1

This is why I have never been able to love anyone else before you .	6

My own husband was killed in this last war .	4

[PERSON] , honey , would you like to freshen up Mr. [PERSON]'s drink a little bit ?	2

The time had come to look the devil in the eye and send him to hell where he belonged .	1

I don't believe what we have done .	1

Now , we better start all over .	2

You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order .	8

They send you champagne .	2

He's lying .	3

And you're gonna ask me questions .	1

If it's OK with you , I'd just like to hold 'em here in my hand .	2

He's being evasive again .	4

ve never been to [LOCATION] L.A.[LOCATION] 	1

He won't eat any steak .	1

I guess one gets the face one deserves .	1

I'm trying , you know it really upsets me .	6

What do you think they're all talking about ,	7

Aren't you supposed to know that ? Isn't that your job ? How could you be stupid enough to let somebody follow you ?	1

They all point to me .	1

I'm not on the pills so we use rubbers , so it's hurting .	1

Stop the presses !	1

Why , you got something ?	7

Sister [PERSON] , you play great game of balls . How come ?	2

Why's she making those funny noises ?	7

I should feed a strange mouth ?	2

I'm gonna love squeezing you out .	2

I was ambitious then .	7

A man's got ta live up to his word .	2

You can't even cook my breakfast .	1

It's a big mistake .	4

Pretty sea . Pretty sand .	5

[PERSON] , I don't know what I'll do when you go .	4

I don't want you smoking in the car tomorrow .	1

Oh , my gosh , you must be [PERSON] !	7

I know all the other teams laugh at me .	5

With her bare hands , she just chopped him down !	1

Ripping out phones , urinating on desks .	1

Mr. [PERSON] loaned me his Bible here so I could practice my reading .	8

Where do they get this crap ?	1

Request permission to leave . - Captain , sir ?	4

Black powder and worse ...	4

Well , we won't stand for it .	1

Tomorrow we begin again .	2

[PERSON] , I came to say goodbye .	6

These two shooters you just brought up from [LOCATION] .	2

It's a better world , we're all bound for .	5

How is that going to look at home ?	2

I was laughing so hard , my drink came out of my nose .	5

They're warming up for it over at [LOCATION] .	2

Did that nickname have anything to do with the typhoon ?	7

This was the most - watched event in the history of the National Press Club .	2

I made reservations at [LOCATION] on [LOCATION] .	2

Of course . Thank you .	8

Jealousy can be destructive .	4

And do remember me kindly to your charming wife .	8

With a little push , we can launch our amphib assault in hours .	2

You wan na help me ? - I'm driving .	2

I've got a job to do , but I'm not hard to get along with .	6

Over my dead body .	6

Hallelujah , brothers !	7

When we invade [LOCATION] , What will the help of [LOCATION] ?	4

I bet you're gonna get a big promotion when this thing's over .	2

His words are too profound	8

Please hurry .	4

Don't cry , honey .	6

The way you say that sounds so ... rote .	7

Happier than we've ever been , yes .	5

Tell [PERSON] 9:[PERSON] , is fine for dinner and see if you can get us into Jams .	2

In fact , I admire the style of you .	8

Just married .	2

I'm your pal .	8

Ah , [PERSON] , old chum .	7

A dollar's a dollar , and every dollar is taking me further West .	2

I am not prepared for wells to run dry !	1

Let me show you to your new house .	2

I don't want any lesson , Shooter .	6

You always do .	8

I'm on my way back to [PERSON] .	8

I'll see you inside the party .	2

We'll keep her here , won't we ?	8

Weren't you , in fact , intimate with the lady ?	7

There's no time !	6

I have a condo with a pool .	2

You mustn't speak to Little Big Man like that .	1

That's a terrible lot of money for a working woman to pay .	6

I've looked all over for shoes like that .	7

Now it's all one big mess .	3

[PERSON] , [PERSON] , [PERSON] .	2

Thank you , thank you , thank you ...	8

The perps are still on the train , okay ?	8

Well , they went to the DA , which means they think you did .	7

Hey , look who's here !	2

You pull one thing , you're out .	1

I'd love to go with you , Mr. [PERSON] .	2

I can see that !	2

I'm ... I'm sorry .	6

Because we belong together .	5

Don't be sure .	4

Don't drink alone .	1

Thanks for coming out here and meeting with him .	8

I'm not ready to retire yet .	1

You better be careful .	8

They're fuckin' horrible - lookin' .	6

You know , maybe it's better you're not staying here .	1

Seriously , must you keep your bicycle in the hall , Father [PERSON] ?	1

And that's the only way to make change , is to make your voice known .	1

We must expose and punish it ...	1

You see that man giving screwface to [PERSON] ?	2

You are ?	2

I don't give the orders , I obey them .	1

This is exactly when we should strike .	2

How stupid .	1

This is okay .	8

Well , I did all my homework .	6

You got him hooked ?	2

You've exceeded everyone's expectations , the way you handled yourself all weekend , but ...	8

What are you accusing me of ?	7

Then you'll finally be rid of me .	4

The poor old governor has to go back to [LOCATION] and live on his pension , right ?	6

What ? What , daddy ?	2

I'd rather negotiate with you any day .	8

Are you saying she was kidnapped ?	7

He shouldn't have to decide here .	1

Give them a taste of their own iron !	3

They laugh and kiss , then they scream and beat each other .	5

And so I turned away my head and wept .	6

Where shall we begin ?	2

Fun but scary .	5

Little Man was very brave .	8

There's a lot of charming people hereabouts , [PERSON] .	5

I'm getting numb all over .	1

I'm moving abroad .	8

Out there , you got me a little wrong .	6

The celebrated list .	5

That's the kind of stuff I like .	5

That might be enough to win this race .	2

As soon as I get it , we'll make tracks .	2

She's very attractive .	5

Oh , is that [PERSON]'s idea ?	7

Why aren't they telling us anything ?	1

It doesn't matter . They run a little family grocery shop back home .	1

Now , please , tell me what I can do .	4

All I'm askin' for is a chance .	2

That's bad management .	6

Yeah , then why are you trying to hurt me ?	6

Come on . I got a schedule to keep .	2

Grow up . Leave your mother .	1

I'm beginning to like it .	2

But he didn't give a shit .	1

With lunch !	2

[PERSON] , [PERSON] man .	7

Got ta have protein . Got ta have eggs .	5

I shall die on the gallows .	6

I admit nothing .	1

I'll do what I can , Mammy .	8

I'm the first to go .	2

Let me give you this watch .	2

The queue was endless .	6

What makes you think we're living in this day and age ?	7

It's to show I love you .	8

Let's go to a nice place .	2

You dumb bastard , why didn't you get some girl off the streets ?	3

[PERSON] has a terrific body .	5

That'll be a good start .	2

I. . . didn't think I'd ever see you again .	6

Yeah , he's bullshit .	1

Let's dance !	2

Good to meet you , Mr. [PERSON] .	8

You couldn't have found anyone more sympathetic to your condition .	1

Look !	2

Bad guy .	1

They had to bring in the coke in wheelbarrows .	1

He's terrific . He's on it .	5

Fuck only knows why [PERSON] lets them in .	1

I'm not investigating her for working for you , I'm investigating her for felony fraud .	1

Oh ! I go there quite often .	2

My heart is packed so full of love for you .	5

[PERSON] , a drink here for my friend .	8

I told you not to pick up the phone .	1

Do you wan na make love ?	8

Taste for fine things .	5

Rosy had eaten and drunk a lot .	5

Or didn't you think magicians could fall in love ?	6

What's that got to do with a train ?	7

Come on , you too !	2

You're going to be one unless you do exactly as I say .	1

Think we should find a rubbish dump or something .	3

There's one on the back , but it's not the right one .	1

Showtime .	7

We're your family now , [PERSON] .	8

He must be in shock . This rush , this adrenaline , the fear .	4

God , I'll lose him .	4

And after dinner we could go ...	2

And anyone who doesn't do right according to nature and my mother I will blow his head off .	1

But they actually had a very thin but tight fitting suit on .	5

You know , so it shouldn't fall apart in his hands .	6

I suppose like the fathead you are , you told Father all your little hopes and dreams ?	1

Look what I found .	2

She died trying to save my daughter .	6

Be a good fellow and get out now .	5

I don't need fuckin' forensics to tell me this was some punk stealing luggage !	1

Which items ?	7

I'll never see you again .	6

You sound sort of peculiar .	7

Why am I here ?	7

That bitch has messed around with me .	1

Then there were some who just got tired of living .	6

[PERSON] , will we be lonely tonight ?	6

Don't you worry about [PERSON] . He can handle himself .	4

Ah . He tucked my parents into bed every night .	5

I hate getting upset .	1

Mr [PERSON] , [PERSON] , I'd like you to meet the greatest guy in the whole wide world .	2

Nothing doing .	1

This way , [PERSON] .	8

Rakonin has just given me the most amazing news .	5

How do you know I won't trick you and turn you in to the hands of the police ?	1

I'm always hiding from him , but he finds me .	4

Do you have a gun ?	1

I think I care too much .	6

Sorry about your finger .	6

It doomed me forever to middle management , and that's the truth .	6

As things are , there's no need for you to go through the Customs .	1

Thank goodness .	8

You idle apathetic !	1

I want to go home , now . I'll talk to [PERSON] .	2

And very heavily .	4

You've got to manage without the doctor .	8

Apparently my birth was not considered a blessed event .	7

I want the Governor's residence , [LOCATION] .	2

I got a ship to run .	4

Isn't this fun ?	5

That's very gracious of you .	5

Spirits soared , women swooned , and gods were created , gentlemen .	7

Because I always get lucky .	5

You look real nice in that ribbon .	5

[PERSON] continued to invade your privacy .	1

I should have taken my chances with the cannibals .	3

Looks like this case will be settled in no time .	2

I want one week to bring you proof and your promise that I will not be expelled and the bill won't be passed .	1

No . - [PERSON] , you're not finished .	1

Those were the last words she heard me say .	7

I got a run of three .	4

If we are to be defeated , then we prefer to be defeated ... as human beings , not as barbarians .	1

The [PERSON] whose testimony nearly sunk us all .	8

Mr. [PERSON] , I really appreciate all the work you do for him , but you and I know that my bloc is growing .	8

Slaughter ! You missed !	1

We're losing the wind !	4

For one thing , it'd get you off the streets .	1

If your men are as cocksure as you are , they might get through .	2

I was wondering if by any chance you guys were hiring .	2

Are you drunk ?	3

I'm drunker than you are , so it'll be a fair fight .	8

I'd have to lead them through .	2

I saw the same book in her room .	7

It means I haven't forgotten whose court I'm on .	6

Not good .	5

Your breath stinks of it .	3

What about dynamite ?	2

Forgive me for not recognizing you , Dr. [PERSON] .	6

Well , because that makes sense .	8

Sure , sure .	8

There's speculation that he's already ...	2

Fatter ? - No , Dad .	3

I want my money . I want to get out of here .	2

You are the most incredible creature I've ever met .	5

In your case , I wanted to test your loyalty to your companions .	8

Anyway , last year he comes to me . He wants some names checked out . Who was where , who's doing what .	2

Best you go ask him yourself .	8

You get a bonus and a raise .	8

I do declare , it looks like my head's gonna split open with all this singing and yelling and hallelujah - ing .	1

And I'll tell you all about that job .	8

The Belgian of the village ?	7

Go fuck a refrigerator , pecker neck !	1

Hold it .	1

Come on !	2

Open the goddamn door , [PERSON] !	1

Extra-terrestrial bodies , yes .	4

I think I'll take a nice dose of sleeping pills tonight .	2

Headless corpses .	7

Have fun !	5

And you and I are going out together .	8

Coming !	2

[PERSON] hates caffeine .	1

That's the stuff he fills the children's heads with !	1

Yeah , no , no !	1

I can't breathe in here .	6

Oh , no . That won't do .	4

He'll use everything in the book and then some he's made up to kill you .	1

When did you get a chance to do this , kid ?	2

[PERSON] , don't .	1

She's a wonderful girl .	5

I know that when there's something wrong , you tell me . But there's something going on that you won't let me understand .	1

Get rid of him , [PERSON] .	1

You ain't gonna have no crop because you got a sin on your soul .	1

We wound up on a train . - A train ?	2

Hey , come on !	2

glad to see you're out of jail .	5

I think I just became the first president to ever publicly mention Area .	2

He gave me some work to do and he left .	8

They're rather fond of me .	6

Isn't it marvellous ?	5

And congratulations . I heard you're going to replace Mr. [PERSON] .	5

Of all directions , why should I have chosen one leading to that parade ground of vulgarity which lies between Nice and [LOCATION] ?	5

[PERSON] , it's tapioca , Your favorite .	5

Then we'll have brunch by my private lake .	2

We can't let you out of here . You know that . Of course .	1

Brought about by what is know as  the miracle of love  .	5

Major [PERSON] will arrange for whatever facilities you may require .	2

Is not it so ?	1

You got ta go see him .	2

Your officers will work beside you .	8

Damn it , get in here !	1

Because you were right about [PERSON] .	2

Then stop calling me .	1

I'll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life .	8

I warned you !	1

No , don't do it .	1

You'd better hurry over there .	2

Come to think of it , everyone did look kind of undressed .	2

I'll get right back to you .	8

He said you were a saintly old man who didn't hold with all the vices .	7

Now what put that into your mind ?	1

I'm so glad to see you .	5

Only in [LOCATION] do people like us rise from oppression and poverty to join hands in this international event .	2

There isn't a cloud in sight .	7

The psycho - vigilante killer continues his daily diet for murder .	4

And you must trust me when I say it's likely we're all going to die .	4

There's more bad ?	4

The cobbler who fixed my shoes so beautifully yesterday .	5

Oh , yeah .	5

Of course , but we are only telling you because we know you'll want to rescue him .	8

Those two guys and [PERSON] , shit man , I seen them take on a gang of guineas with nothing but a knife and a broken bottle in their hand .	1

You think he's gonna say , I've had it  ? 	1

We ain't never been friends .	6

I don't want you to be angry with me for having predicted it . What ?	1

Oh , great news , I got some turkey burgers , you know we can grill , and watch a little Monday Night Raw tonight if you want ?	2

I'm pleased that we're having this closed executive session .	5

She did what ?	7

Loveliest room you've ever seen .	5

All right , [PERSON] boy , what we got ?	2

But why do you bring this up now ?	7

You know I am obliged to report you to the authorities .	8

Come on , you're kidding me , right ?	1

You don't have a boy !	1

You never wore that before .	7

You're not making any sense .	1

They gave me a piece of candy in the store .	2

Your skin stinks of it .	3

Tell her about our special student housing program .	2

But people just respected him , respected his , uh ...	8

Boys ...	7

And so will you .	8

I still insist he's paranoid .	1

Is that what you want ?	2

I hate him so fucking much .	1

I was so proud .	8

If you're dirty , you're going .	3

Did you come to see me for the same reason as the man with sweat on his face ?	3

Hey , it's all right , baby .	5

I'm not takin' a shower with him .	1

Let's do some good .	8

Hey , you're looking good .	5

Have they moved the embassy , or are you hijacking me ?	8

What that !	7

Imagine interplanetary trade , how exciting that would be ?	2
